Objective:
The objective of this project was to analyze the sales and performance data of Toman Bike Shop to identify key trends, 
profitability, and demographic insights. The project involved extracting and transforming data using SQL, followed by 
creating an interactive and comprehensive dashboard in Power BI to visualize the findings.

Project Steps
Data Extraction and Preparation (SQL):
Step 1: Connected to the database containing Toman Bike Shop sales data.
Step 2: Extracted relevant data tables such as sales transactions, rider demographics, and seasonal revenue.
Step 3: Cleaned and transformed the data using SQL queries to ensure accuracy and consistency. This included handling 
missing values, removing duplicates, and aggregating data to the required level of granularity.

Data Analysis (SQL):
Step 4: Performed detailed data analysis to derive key metrics such as total revenue, total profit, number of riders, and 
profit margins.
Step 5: Analyzed hourly, daily, and seasonal sales patterns to identify peak times and days with the highest profitability.
Step 6: Examined rider demographics to understand the distribution between casual and registered riders.

Dashboard Creation (Power BI):
Step 7: Imported the cleaned and processed data into Power BI.
Step 8: Designed the layout of the dashboard, ensuring it is user-friendly and informative.
Step 9: Created various visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and tables to represent the data:
Revenue and Profit Over Time: Line and bar charts showing monthly revenue and profit trends for 2022.
When are We Making Money?: A table displaying hourly sales data across the week, highlighting the most profitable times 
and days.
Revenue By Season: Bar charts showing the seasonal revenue distribution.
Rider Demographic: A pie chart illustrating the proportion of casual versus registered riders.
Step 10: Implemented interactive elements such as filters and slicers to allow users to explore the data dynamically, 
including filters for year selection (2021 and 2022).

Dashboard Review and Testing:
Step 11: Tested the dashboard for accuracy and performance, ensuring all visualizations correctly reflect the underlying data.
Step 12: Reviewed the dashboard with stakeholders to gather feedback and made necessary adjustments.

Key Insights

Gained insights into rider demographics, allowing for targeted marketing efforts towards casual or registered riders.
Visualized key performance indicators (KPIs) over time, providing a clear overview of the shopâ€™s financial health and trends.

Conclusion
This project successfully leveraged SQL for data extraction and transformation, followed by the creation of an insightful 
Power BI dashboard. The resulting dashboard provides Toman Bike Shop with valuable insights into their sales performance, 
rider demographics, and profitability, enabling data-driven decision-making to enhance business operations.
